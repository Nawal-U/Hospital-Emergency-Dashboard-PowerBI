# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard
## Overview
Created a Power BI dashboard to enhance operational efficiency and provide actionable insights into emergency room performance. This solution will enable stakeholders to track, analyze, and make data-driven decisions regarding patient management and service

## Key Metrics Tracked
- Number of Patients
- Average wait time
- Patient Satisfaction score
- Number of Patients Referred

## Dataset Used

## Actionable Insights & Recommendations
- Analysis identified consistent peak volumes on Mondays, Saturdays, and Tuesdays, with demand concentrated around late morning and evening hours. Recommended adjusting staffing models and shift overlaps during these periods to support patient flow and reduce system strain, aligning with hospital capacity management goals.
- With an average ER wait time of 35.3 minutes, findings support the introduction of rapid triage or fast-track pathways for low-acuity patients to reduce congestion and improve timely access to care, consistent with Canadian ED performance improvement initiatives.
- Moderate patient satisfaction scores (4.99/10) showed sensitivity to wait times and peak demand. Recommended targeted service improvements such as improved communication of wait times and patient expectations, supporting patient-centred care standards.
- Referral trends showed high downstream demand for General Practice and Orthopedics, indicating the need for coordinated capacity planning across departments to avoid bottlenecks and delays in care transitions.
- With nearly equal proportions of patients admitted versus treated and released, insights support the development of short-stay units or enhanced discharge pathways to improve throughput and reduce emergency department crowding.
- Demographic analysis highlighted a diverse patient population across age and racial groups, reinforcing the importance of equity-based planning and culturally responsive care, aligned with public health equity and population health objectives in Canada.
- The Power BI dashboard provides ongoing visibility into key ER performance indicators, enabling hospital administrators and public health decision-makers to monitor trends, assess interventions, and support continuous quality improvement initiatives.
